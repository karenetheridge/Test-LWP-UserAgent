          constructor.

          - documentation on integration with XML::Compile::SOAP
          - questionable uses of eval { $foo->isa } converted to Safe::Isa
          - imported subs no longer available as methods

          - fix test to work with older (pre-6.00) LWP::UserAgent, when
            _new_response did not take a content argument

0.008     2012-08-21 12:48:35 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - better handling when the response implementation dies, either
            with an error message or an HTTP::Response object
          - network_fallback and map_network_response features added, for
            sending any or all requests through to the real LWP::UserAgent
          - new feature: "last_useragent", for getting the last useragent
            object used globally
          - allow exact string matching against domains to work even for
            domains specified via a string-overloaded object
          - bug fix: properly mask existing mappings in
            $ua->map_response(..., undef) (v0.007)

          - cleanup of domain->PSGI app functionality for stable release:
            - string mappings in map_response now match against the URI host,
              not the full URI string
            - register_domain is now called register_psgi; unregister_domain
              is now unregister_psgi; unregister_all is removed, as unmap_all
              will do the right thing
            - domain mappings no longer take priority over other mapped
              responses; all mappings are now tested in the order they were
              added (with instance mappings matched first over global
              mappings, as before)

          - new domain->PSGI app functionality, and methods register_domain,
            unregister_domain, unregister_all

          - additional error checking and tests
          - also support objects with &{} overloading, in place of subrefs
          - now doing the same end-of-response cleanup handling that the real LWPUA does:
            - saving the request on the response
            - adding Client-Date header
            - respect show_progress settings
            - runs handlers

0.004     2012-06-27 15:41:02 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - map_response now accepts a coderef in place of the HTTP::Response
            object to return, to allow basing the response data on what was in
            the request

0.003     2012-06-23 22:11:53 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - fix compile error on perls earlier than 5.9.5 (which did not have
            re::is_regexp)

0.002     2012-06-23 09:36:51 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - minor documentation fixes
          - renamed from Test::Mock::LWP::UserAgent to Test::LWP::UserAgent
            (thanks, mst!)

0.001     2012-06-22 17:11:20 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - Initial release, in all its questionable glory.
